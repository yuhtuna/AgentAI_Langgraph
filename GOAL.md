Project Genesis: AI-Powered Application Platform
Important: Consider to integrate with narbtech!
1. Vision & Mission üéØ
Vision: To create a premier low-code/no-code platform that allows anyone‚Äîfrom entrepreneurs to enterprise users‚Äîto design, build, deploy, and analyze custom business logic as a functional application without writing a single line of code.

Mission for the Dev Team: Our mission is to engineer a sophisticated multi-agent system using langgraph. This system will form the core of the platform, capable of autonomously planning, developing, testing, and deploying applications, as well as providing post-deployment business intelligence.

2. Core Architecture & Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è
The system is architected as a stateful graph where each node represents a specific function performed by an AI agent. langgraph manages the state and orchestrates the complex control flow.

3. The langgraph Implementation üìà
The entire application builder is defined as a single, cohesive StatefulGraph.

The AgentState
This is the central data structure for our application-building workflow. It is designed to be dynamic, supporting in-flight modifications to the project plan.

from typing import TypedDict, List, Optional, Dict

class Task(TypedDict):
    id: int
    role: str # e.g., 'CodeWorker', 'TestWriter'
    goal: str
    status: str # 'pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'cancelled', 'failed'
    dependencies: List[int] # List of other task IDs to be completed first
    result: Optional[str]
    generated_test_cases: Optional[List[str]]
    self_validation_status: Optional[str] # e.g., 'Passed', 'Failed'

class ValidationReport(TypedDict):

Graph Nodes: The AI Development Team
manager_node (Entry Point & Human-in-the-Loop): This agent acts as the central project manager and the primary, continuous interface with the user. See Section 5 for the detailed HITL workflow.

retriever_node: Queries the vector database using the clarified_request and the user_id from the state. It performs two queries: one against the user's Private KB and one against the Global KB, then merges the results.

manager_planning_node: Decomposes the request into a detailed task_plan. This node is re-triggered by the manager_node whenever the user modifies the project, taking the new context to create a revised plan.

resource_monitor_node: Provides a cost_estimate based on the plan and tracks real-time API usage.

worker_node: A pool of specialized agents that perform the core development tasks. See Section 4 for details on its self-validation process.

aggregator_node: Synthesizes the work from all successfully self-validated workers in completed_tasks into a final_deliverable.

tester_node: Validates the fully integrated final_deliverable against the user's overall requirements. See Section 4.

Graph Edges: The Workflow Logic
The graph logic remains the same, but the state now carries the user_id to ensure context-aware operations.

4. Multi-Layered Testing & Quality Assurance
To ensure the delivery of high-quality, reliable applications, our platform employs a two-tiered testing strategy. This combines granular, component-level validation with holistic, system-wide testing.

4.1. Worker Self-Validation (Intensive Testing Mode)
This is the first line of defense against bugs and errors. When "Intensive Testing Mode" is enabled by the user, it changes the behavior of each worker_node.

Process:

Build: The worker agent first completes its primary task (e.g., writes a Python function, creates a UI component).

Test Case Generation: The agent then analyzes the code it just wrote and uses an LLM to generate a set of specific unit or integration tests designed to validate that single component.

Execution & Verification: The agent executes these generated tests in a sandboxed environment.

Report: The task is only marked as "Passed" and submitted to the aggregator_node if all self-generated tests succeed. If any test fails, the worker can attempt to fix its own code and re-run the tests, creating a micro-correction loop.

Benefit: This catches errors at the earliest possible stage, preventing faulty components from ever being integrated into the main application. It leads to a more stable final product but requires more LLM calls and processing time, making it an optional feature.

4.2. Final Validation (Tester Agent)
This is the second layer of QA, performed by the dedicated tester_node.

Process: After all worker tasks are completed and aggregated, the tester_node receives the complete, integrated application (final_deliverable).

Holistic Testing: It validates the entire application against the user's original request. This includes checking for functional correctness, ensuring all requested features are present, and verifying that the application's behavior matches the user's intent.

Self-Correction Trigger: If the tester_node finds a discrepancy, it generates a detailed failure report. This report triggers the main self-correction loop, sending the project back to the manager_planning_node with specific feedback on what needs to be fixed.

5. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) & Dynamic Planning
To create a truly collaborative platform, the system must handle user interruptions and mid-stream changes gracefully. This is achieved via a "smart pause" and dynamic re-planning workflow orchestrated by the manager_node.

The HITL Workflow
User Interrupt: The user sends a new message during the project (e.g., "add a dark mode toggle"). The FastAPI backend signals the langgraph execution to pause.

Manager-Led Impact Analysis: The manager_node is invoked with the current AgentState and the new user request. It uses an LLM to perform an impact analysis on the task_plan.

Intelligent Plan Modification: Based on the analysis, the manager updates the task_plan in the state by performing a series of actions:

CANCEL: Sets the status of obsolete pending tasks to 'cancelled'. The worker_node logic will ignore these.

MODIFY: Updates the goal of a pending task. If a task is already in_progress, it may be cancelled and a new, modified task created to ensure consistency.

ADD: Appends new tasks to the plan with appropriate dependencies.

Workflow Resume: The langgraph execution is resumed with the updated AgentState. Unaffected workers continue their tasks without interruption, while others pick up the revised plan.

6. Knowledge Base & Autonomous Learning
The system's intelligence is amplified by a Vector Database that serves as its long-term memory. To ensure data privacy and security, this is implemented using a multi-tenant architecture.

Data Privacy & Multi-Tenancy
The knowledge base is not a single, global entity. It is partitioned into two distinct scopes:

Private Knowledge Base (Per User/Tenant):

Content: A completely isolated namespace containing all proprietary information for a user: uploaded documents, specific business logic, conversation history, and the exact code generated for their applications.

Access Control: This data is strictly confidential. It can only be accessed during a job initiated by that specific user. The user_id in the AgentState is used to query the correct private namespace.

Global Knowledge Base (Public & Anonymized):

Content: A shared knowledge base containing generic, non-proprietary information that benefits all users. This includes public API documentation, open-source code patterns, and general programming best practices.

Learning Mechanism: After a project is successfully completed, a separate process can abstract and anonymize the solution. This process removes all proprietary logic and data, creating a generic "template" or "pattern" that can be safely added to the Global KB.

Implementation
Retrieval: The retriever_node queries both the user's Private KB (using their user_id) and the Global KB. It then merges these results to provide the most comprehensive context to the planning agent.

Learning: The "save to KB" process after a successful job must distinguish between saving proprietary data to the user's Private KB and saving an anonymized pattern to the Global KB.

7. Automated Deployment Task
A key capability of the platform is the agent's ability to deploy the applications it builds.

Objective: Integrate the Google Cloud SDK into the agent's available tools.

Functionality: This will empower the worker_node with a new set of capabilities, allowing it to perform actions such as:

Provisioning cloud resources (e.g., virtual machines, storage buckets).

Deploying applications using services like Google App Engine or Cloud Run.

Managing configurations and monitoring deployed applications.

8. Post-Deployment: Deep Service Analysis
Once an application is successfully built and deployed, the platform offers a Deep Service Analysis mode. This is a dedicated feature designed to provide users with actionable business intelligence about their live application.

Frontend: The Analytics Dashboard
The user will access a new dashboard for their deployed application, featuring:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): A clear display of core metrics like Site Visitors, Unique Users, User Engagement Time, and Conversion Rates.

Trend Visualization: Interactive charts showing performance data over time (e.g., daily user growth, feature popularity).

Cost & Resource Monitoring: A transparent view of the application's operational costs.

Business Estimation & Insights: An AI-driven section that provides natural language analysis and strategic advice.

Backend: The Analytics Service
This feature is not part of the main langgraph building workflow but is a separate service that runs post-deployment.

Data Collection: When the agent deploys an application, it will also inject a lightweight, anonymized tracking script (or configure platform-native logging like Google Analytics).

Scheduled Analysis: A separate, scheduled process (e.g., a daily cron job) will trigger a dedicated Analytics Agent to process the data and generate insights.

API Endpoint: A new FastAPI endpoint (e.g., /api/v1/apps/{app_id}/analytics) will serve this processed data to the frontend dashboard.
